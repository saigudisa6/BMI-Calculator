            BMI, Body Mass Index, is a numerical value calculated based on their weight and height. 
            This value lets you gauge at your health status and estimate your body composition. 
            Although BMI doesn't measure body fat percentage, it does aid in identifying potential weight-related health risks. 
            At the end of the day, BMI is limited in its ability to ascertain muscle mass, bone density, and other individual factors (this is especially the case for athletes). Consulting a healthcare professional should always be your first choice when faced with any dangerous problems.

                        BMI is a reasonable indicator of body fat for both adults and children. Because BMI
                        does not measure body fat directly, it should not be used as a diagnostic tool. Instead,
                        BMI should be used as a measure to track weight status in populations and as a
                        screening tool to identify potential weight problems in individuals
